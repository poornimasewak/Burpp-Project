# Burpp
A one-stop food app that caters to everyday food indecision. This app will allow you to search for any cuisine/ingredient and will cleanly display all of your available dine-in or cooking options nearby.

Our App:
We were all very passionate about food and eating but we also recognized that we live in a fast-paced world and needed a food app that could keep up with our constant indecision. By putting recipes and restaurants side-by-side, it will allow the user the freedom to change their mind on a whim.

We also wanted to build a community of trust and honesty with our users which is why we have given them the freedom to type in any food related craving they have in the food search input bar. It will populate regardless, so this app is useful even if you're just looking for ideas! We also promote this trust and honesty concept by not having user reviews censored before posting on the "Review" section.

# Burpp
An app where a user can search for any cuisine/food/ingredient and restaurants and recipes featuring what you've typed in will populate.

Our App:
We were all very passionate about food and eating but we also recognized that we live in a fast-paced world and needed a food app that could keep up with our constant indecision. By putting recipes and restaurants side-by-side, it will allow the user the freedom to change their mind on a whim.

We also wanted to build a community of trust and honesty with our users which is why we have given them the freedom to type in any food related craving they have in the food search input bar. It will populate regardless, so this app is useful even if you're just looking for ideas! We also promote this trust and honesty concept by not having user reviews censored before posting on the "Review" section.

Technologies Used:
We used Sublime Text, AJAX, Firebase and Bootstrap.
For our API's, we chose to go with the Edaman API (recipes) and the Yelp API (restaurants).

Prerequisities:
You must login before using this service. Login using the modal on the home page.

Instructions:
1) Login
2) Type in your desired cuisine/ingredient/food idea
3) Type in your location
4) Watch the Recipes | Restaurants page populate with top 10 options
5) Leave a comment in the "Be Heard" section 
6) Watch your comment get posted in real-time in the "Reviews" section


Built With:
Sublime Text
Bootstrap - Bootstrap is responsible for the theme that we designed our app on.
Firebase

Interesting Conflicts Along the Way:
Had some trouble with the Yelp API call. Had to work with OAuth to get it working.
